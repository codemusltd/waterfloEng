                        <span class='w3-capitalize'>Waterflo Engineering</span> was initially founded in the late <span id ='sixties'>60s</span> as <span id='lacoste'> Lacoste Irrigation</span>. It was   mainly manufacturing aluminum irrigation fittings. In the early 80s the company was bought by the
                        <span class='bolder orangeYellow'>Cornish</span> <span class='underline'>family</span> who renamed it <span  class='bolder orangeYellow'>Waterflo Irrigation</span>. They expanded the activities to manufacturing
                brass sprinklers design and installation of mainly pressurized turnkey irrigation projects. Mainly for
                irrigating wheat. In 2000 the company was bought as a going concern by the current owners.
                The companyâ€™s purpose is to design, construct and commission sustainable water supply and
                Irrigation projects. Most of the projects are turnkey although some times we do construction only
                or design only. In 2013 Waterflo was registered in Mozambique and has been doing mainly
                construction of irrigation projects.
